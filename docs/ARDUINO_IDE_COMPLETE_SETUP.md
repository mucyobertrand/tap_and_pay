```

**Change them to your actual WiFi:**

```cpp
// WiFi Configuration
const char* WIFI_SSID = "MyHomeWiFi";        // ← Your WiFi name
const char* WIFI_PASSWORD = "mypassword123";  // ← Your WiFi password
```

**Important Notes:**
- ⚠️ ESP8266 **only supports 2.4GHz WiFi** (NOT 5GHz)
- Keep the quotation marks
- WiFi name is case-sensitive
- Make sure your WiFi doesn't have special characters that could cause issues

### Step 17: Verify Configuration

Double-check these settings in the code:

```cpp
const char* MQTT_BROKER = "broker.benax.rw";  // ✓ Should be this
const int MQTT_PORT = 1883;                    // ✓ Should be this
const char* TEAM_ID = "rdf";                   // ✓ Should be this
```

These should already be correct from the files I provided.
